Minimal youtube rss reader which does not require Javascript to use. The 
web interface generates a non-clickable link to a video in the feed, so 
one does not click it by accident and is not redirected to a full 
youtube website and a clickable embed-video link. The Youtube 
embed-video player does require Javascript to use, but does not load the 
entire website with recommendations etc.

To configure the appllication, edit the extract.ini file. Each section 
corresponds to one youtube channel. You can have as many channels as you 
like. All channels are rendered on the index webpage in a single list.

Each channel has three items to configure:
- path: enter a XML filename where ytrss will store the feed on a disk.
- id: this is a youtube internal ID of a channel. You can find it by 
viewing HTML source when on a youtube channel; search for "externalId".
- title: this will be title displayed in ytrss above the feed items.

To load the feeds, either run the python script cron.py OR if you feel 
like anyone can refresh the feeds at will through the web interface, 
set REFRESH_URLS to TRUE in the index.php file. A refresh link will 
appear next to each feed. Note you will require the Curl PHP extension 
on your server for it to work.
