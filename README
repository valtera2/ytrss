Minimal youtube rss reader which does not require Javascript to use.

To configure the appllication, edit the extract.ini file. Each section 
corresponds to one youtube channel. All channels are rendered on the index webpage in a single list.

Each channel has three items to configure:
- path: enter a XML filename where ytrss will store the feed on a disk.
- id: this is a youtube internal ID of a channel. You can find it by 
viewing HTML source when on a youtube channel; search for "externalId".
- title: this will be title displayed in ytrss above the feed items.

To load the feeds, either run the python script cron.py OR if you feel 
like anyone can refresh the feeds at will through the web interface, 
set REFRESH_URLS to TRUE in the index.php file. A refresh link will 
appear next to each feed. Note you will require the Curl PHP extension 
on your server for it to work.
